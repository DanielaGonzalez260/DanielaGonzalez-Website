        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Daniela Gonzalez! I am a first year and also first generation Hispanic college student. I am currently A full time student attending the University of California, Riverside in an aim to major in Psychology BA. I hope to be able to help both my community and anyone in need with my major. I would like to service my community in any way possible while applying skills and concepts I have learned throughout college. I am looking for an environment and job that allows me to express my creativity and the techniques I have learned. Additionally, I hope to learn, listen and cooperate with fellow colleagues in order to succeed personally and professionally.<br><br>

        Furthermore, I am bilingual, I speak and write both fluent English and Spanish. This is helpful because it allows me to speak, help, and connect to more individuals in a daily language; as when speaking to someone in a language they are fluent in makes them more comfortable. Also, I am extremely punctual, organized, and I have great time management. These skills are important in a working setting as they allow you to look professional with clients or customers and allows your work space to be clean. Further, it allows you to communicate with your colleagues and avoid any misinterpretations and to cooperate together. <br><br>

        To continue, I have been part of a variety of clubs and organizations that have taught me many skills. I was a part of the UPLM Organization which focuses mainly in San Bernardino and Riverside County; UPLM is an Organization that helps low income families with basic necessities like food. While volunteering with this program I was accountable for organizing, separating, and unloading food. Furthermore, I also helped keep count of personal information logs and the individuals that would come pick up their basic necessities. In doing so I learned the skills of patience and organization. These skills help me interact with others and have a clean work environment, which helps me accomplish a goal in an efficient manner. Additionally, I was also a part of a big club at my high school called Spanish Honor Society which is well recognized around the world. In the Spanish Honor Society we emphasized the importance of biliteracy, helping fellow students learn Spanish, and organizing events. In having the opportunity to participate in all these activities it has taught me to be a good communicator. Moreover, I was on the AVID Board for my high school; my specific title was Outreach Officer. This allowed me to heavily work with social media, more specifically, Instagram, Twitter, Canva, and Link Tree. Aside from social media, I was a mentor for my peers teaching them how to use Instagram to advertise the program and tips they could use. This taught me a main skill used widely today, social media. Social Media has become a major part of our society and mastering its use helps communicate with people all around the world, your community, and to teach others.
